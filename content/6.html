<h1> A haunted house </h1><br/>
Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in the hills of a distant land. The village was known for its peacefulness, its rolling green hills, and its abundance of wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
But there was one place in the village that was avoided by all of its inhabitants. It was an old abandoned house perched on a hilltop and shrouded in a dark cloud of mystery. The villagers whispered of strange noises and eerie lights that would sometimes flicker through the windows of the house.<br/>
<br/>
No one dared to enter the house, and so it sat, untouched and forgotten, until one daring and curious soul decided to explore it. As the brave explorer stepped inside the house, they were met with a chill that seemed to go right to their bones.<br/>
<br/>
The explorer stumbled through the dark and dusty rooms, feeling their way around in the eerie silence. They quickly realized, as they reached the top of the stairs, that the house wasn’t abandoned at all. Instead, it was haunted by a host of spirits and ghosts, all of them determined to keep the house from anyone who tried to enter.<br/>
<br/>
The explorer ran from the house in terror, never to return. But the legend of the haunted house remains, a reminder of the danger that lurks in the dark and mysterious places of the world.</body>
