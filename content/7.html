<h1> 3 pigs and the wolf </h1><br/>
Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. One pig built a house of straw, one built a house of sticks, and the third built a house of brick.<br/>
<br/>
One day, a wolf came to their doorsteps, huffing and puffing. He threatened to blow down the houses of the three pigs if they didn't let him in. The first two pigs, who had built their homes out of straw and sticks, quickly let the wolf in. However, the third pig, who had built his house of brick, kept the wolf out.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf, frustrated, tried to blow down the house of brick, but his attempts were futile. He huffed and he puffed, but he could not blow the house down. Eventually, the wolf had to give up and go away.<br/>
<br/>
The three pigs were very relieved and happy that their brick house had kept them safe. From then on, they were extra careful when it came to building their homes.</body>
