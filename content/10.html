<h1> rabbit  </h1><br/>
Once upon a time, there was a mischievous rabbit that lived in the forest. Every morning, the rabbit would hop out of its burrow and explore the surrounding area. It loved to cause trouble and play pranks on all the other animals in the forest.<br/>
<br/>
One day, the rabbit came across a large field that seemed to go on forever. It was filled with the most beautiful flowers and smelled like the sweetest nectar. The rabbit wanted to explore the entire field, but it was so vast that the rabbit became overwhelmed with how much there was to see.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit decided to take a break and hopped onto a nearby log. It was then that the rabbit noticed a small hole in the trunk of the log. The rabbit curiously stuck its head inside the hole and realized that it was the entrance to an underground tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit followed the tunnel until it came to a vast chamber filled with precious gems and jewels. The rabbit was so excited that it forgot all about the beautiful field and immediately began to collect as many gems and jewels as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit gathered enough gems and jewels to last a lifetime and hopped back through the tunnel and out into the forest. From then on, the rabbit was known as the wealthiest creature in the forest and was able to live happily ever after.</body>
